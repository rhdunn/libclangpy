# libclangpy

The libclangpy project is a Python binding to the libclang API. It differs from
the cindex bindings from LLVM/clang in that it:

1.  is complete for the target version of libclang;

2.  annotates which libclang version is needed by each API;

3.  provides a cleaner, more pythonic API;

4.  provides backward compatibility for several APIs.
